## Add-on UI reference

Every control lives in the 3D Viewport sidebar (press <kbd>N</kbd>) under the
**OpenRCT2** tab. There are two panels:

- **OpenRCT2 Scenery**: scene-level: what to build and how
- **Selected Object → Scenery**: per-object and per-material settings for the
  mesh you have selected

Every field below maps 1:1 to a key in the CLI config (see [Example
configs](#example-configs)); the UI is just a front-end for the same build.

### Panel: OpenRCT2 Scenery (scene-level)

**Top of panel — what you're building**

| Control | Values / default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Type** | Small Scenery *(default)* / Large Scenery / Wall / Banner / Path Addition / Scenery Group | Selects the object kind. Changes which type-specific box appears below and which exporter runs. Scenery Group has no geometry, so it hides the scale/placement/lighting sections. |
| **Scale** | Realistic (3.3 m/tile) *(default)* / 1 unit = 1 tile / Custom | How many OBJ units span one OpenRCT2 tile. Drives sprite size and the tile-anchor maths. "Realistic" matches RCT2's real-world tile scale; "1 unit = 1 tile" lets you model in tile units. |
| **Units / Tile** | float, default `3.3`, min `0.01` | Only shown when **Scale = Custom**. The raw units-per-tile value; the presets just write this for you. |

**Identity box** — object metadata written into `object.json`.

| Control | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Object ID** | `openrct2sg.scenery_small.my_object` | Unique object id (e.g. `author.scenery_small.obj`). Avoid clashing with vanilla ids. Also seeds the default `.parkobj` filename on export. |
| **Name** | `My Scenery` | In-game display name. |
| **Authors** | *(empty)* | Comma-separated author list. |
| **Version** | `1.0` | Object version string. |

**Placement box** — gameplay/placement behaviour. The fields shown adapt to the
type: banners drop Removal Price / Cursor / Secondary Colour; path additions show
only Price / Cursor / Scenery Group; scenery groups hide the box entirely.

| Control | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Price** | `2.0` | Build cost. |
| **Removal Price** | `1.0` | Refund/cost to remove. |
| **Cursor** | Statue Down | Mouse cursor shown while placing. Closed dropdown of the `CURSOR_*` ids OpenRCT2 accepts. |
| **Scenery Group** | *(empty)* | Optional scenery-group object id this belongs to. |
| **Primary Colour** | off | Force a primary placement colour. Tagging any material **Remap 1** enables this automatically; the toggle only matters to force it on without a Remap 1 material. |
| **Secondary Colour** | off | Force a secondary placement colour. A **Remap 2** material enables it automatically. |
| **Tertiary Colour** | off | *(Small Scenery only, in this box)* Force a third placement colour. A **Remap 3** material enables it automatically. |

**Small Scenery box** *(Type = Small Scenery)*

| Control | Values / default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Shape** | `1/4`, `2/4`, `3/4`, `4/4` *(default)*, `1/4+D`, `4/4+D` | Footprint: how many tile quadrants the object occupies. `+D` is a full-tile diagonal variant. `2/4` (half-tile) objects paint from a tile-corner anchor with a real half-tile bounding box — model the piece in the **+X** half of the tile. |
| **Height** | int, default `64`, min `0` | Clearance height in Z coordinate units (8 units per height step). Gameplay value, independent of the rendered sprite. |
| **Rotatable** | on | Object has 4 rotations (renders 4 viewpoints) instead of 1. |
| **Stackable** | off | Can be stacked / placed on top of other scenery. |
| **Requires Flat Surface** | off | Only placeable on flat ground. |
| **Prohibit Walls** | off | Blocks walls on the same tile. |
| **Tree** | off | Flags the object as a tree (affects some gameplay rules). |
| **Wide Bounding Box** | off | Paint with a near-full-tile bounding box (engine `VOFFSET_CENTRE` flag). Without it a full-tile object sorts from a tiny 2×2 box at the tile centre, which glitches the draw order of diagonal/wall-like pieces. Vanilla diagonal walls combine `4/4+D` + this + **Prohibit Walls** (which widens the box to the whole tile). |

**Animation box** *(Type = Small Scenery)* — samples Blender keyframes into
animation poses. All controls below the toggle appear only when **Animated** is on.

| Control | Values / default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Animated** | off | Turn the object into an animated small-scenery object by sampling scene keyframes. |
| **Cycle** | 4 / 8 *(default)* / 16 / 32 / 64 / 128 / 256 frames | Number of animation steps before looping. Must be a power of two (the engine masks the tick counter). Higher = more sprites. |
| **Playback** | Loop *(default)* / Ping-Pong | Loop replays 0…N-1 then jumps to 0; Ping-Pong plays forward then back (smooth for swings/pendulums). |
| **Speed (delay)** | int, default `1`, range `0–15` | Tick bit-shift: higher = slower playback. |
| **Deformation** | Auto *(default)* / Bake all / Rigid only | How animated geometry is sampled. **Auto** bakes a fresh mesh per pose only for objects with an armature/deform modifier or animated shape keys and keeps the rest rigid; **Bake all** re-extracts every object's mesh each pose (one mesh per pose — use for deformation Auto misses); **Rigid only** animates transforms only (deformation frozen at rest). |
| **Start Frame / End Frame** | `1` / `24` | Scene frame range to sample. If End ≤ Start the scene's own frame range is used. With **Loop** the range is one full cycle — End is the last frame *before* the loop repeats — so poses are spaced evenly around the loop without duplicating the seam; with **Ping-Pong** both ends are sampled as the turning points. |

**Wall box** *(Type = Wall)* — model the panel running along OBJ **+Z**, with
its **front face toward −X**. The front is what shows when the wall sits on the
two far tile edges; a double-sided wall's Back faces show on the near edges.
(As in vanilla RCT2, a single-sided wall re-uses its front sprites when viewed
from behind, so it appears end-mirrored from those two rotations.)

| Control | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Height** | int, default `2`, min `1` | Wall height in wall units; the engine renders it `× 8` coordinate units tall (distinct from small scenery's `Height` clearance). |
| **Allowed on Slope** | on | Placeable on sloped terrain; adds the 4 slope sprites. |
| **Has Glass** | off | Wall has translucent glass panes; materials marked **Glass** are split into a separate overlay block. |
| **Double-Sided** | off | Distinct front/back faces (materials marked Front/Back via **Wall Side**); the rear block renders offset by +6. |
| **Tertiary Colour** | off | Force a third placement colour. A **Remap 3** material enables it automatically. |
| **Opaque** | off | Wall fully occludes the tile behind it (no see-through gaps). |
| **Door** | off | Make the wall an animated door (peeps pass through). Keyframe the leaf swinging open over the **Start/End Frame** range; the renderer samples 5 poses and renders each from its per-direction viewpoint to fill the engine's fixed 36-image door table. **Long Door Animation** and an optional **Door Sound** id are nested under it. Mutually exclusive with **Animated**. |
| **Animated** | off | Cycle a flat-only **8-frame** animation sampled from the scene keyframes over the **Start/End Frame** range. Greys out slope/glass/double-sided (they'd alias the frames) and is mutually exclusive with **Door**. |

> Glass + double-sided isn't supported together — the UI warns and the
> double-sided flag is dropped. Doors and animated walls keyframe their geometry
> like animated small scenery (set **Deformation** + **Start/End Frame**); model
> a door's swinging leaf as the moving part and its posts/lintel as static so the
> static frame lands in the door's separate top-occlusion layer.

**Large Scenery box** *(Type = Large Scenery)*

| Control | Values / default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Tertiary Colour** | off | Force a third placement colour. A **Remap 3** material enables it automatically. |
| **Photogenic** | off | Marks the object as a good photo subject (peeps take photos of it). |
| **Scrolling Mode** | int, default `255`, range `0–255` | `255` = no scrolling text. Only set a real mode for scrolling signs (mode 0 is a *valid, active* mode, so leave it at 255 otherwise). |
| **Tiles** | list | The multi-tile footprint. Use **＋ / －** to add/remove tiles; each tile exposes **X**, **Y** (tile *indices* along OBJ +X / +Z), **Z** (height offset, coordinate units) and **Clearance** (vertical clearance, coordinate units, default `40`). At least one tile is required. |
| **Supports** / **Supports Above** *(per tile)* | off | Whether the selected tile draws vertical supports to the ground, and whether another object's supports may rest on top of it. |
| **Occupied Quadrants** *(per tile)* | all on | Which of the tile's 4 quadrants this piece fills (the `corners` mask; drives selection / terrain clipping). |
| **Wall Edges** *(per tile)* | all off | Which of the tile's 4 edges allow a wall against this piece (the `walls` mask). |

**Banner box** *(Type = Banner)* — model the sign + poles along the tile edge.

| Control | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Scrolling Mode** | int, default `255`, range `0–255` | `255` = no scrolling text; set a real mode for a scrolling sign. |

Tag the sign material **Back** (rear pole) or **Front** (front pole + sign) via
the per-material **Banner Layer** picker; untagged faces fall into the front
layer. A **Remap 1** sign material is recoloured by the primary placement colour
(enabling **Primary Colour** automatically).

**Path Addition box** *(Type = Path Addition)* — model the item centred on the
tile origin; the engine places it on open path edges.

| Control | Values / default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Render As** | Lamp *(default)* / Bin / Bench / Fountain | How the engine draws & indexes the sprites. Also sets the matching draw-type flag (`isBin`/`isBench`/`isLamp`). |
| **Breakable** *(lamp/bench)* | off | Can be vandalised; adds a block of 4 broken sprites. |
| **Queue TV** *(lamp)* | off | A queue-line television. |
| **Jumping Fountain (Water/Snow)** *(fountain)* | off | Fountain spray type. |
| **Allowed on Queue** | on | May be placed on queue paths. |
| **Allowed on Slope** | on | May be placed on sloped paths. |

> Distinct vandalised/full art isn't authored in the add-on — those slots reuse
> the normal sprites. Supply `broken_meshes` / `full_meshes` via the CLI config
> for separate art.

**Scenery Group box** *(Type = Scenery Group)* — a tab; no geometry.

| Control | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Priority** | int, default `40`, range `0–255` | Sort order of the tab (lower = earlier). |
| **Tab Icon** | *(none)* | Image datablock used as the tab icon; saved to PNG and palette-mapped on export. |
| **Member objects** | list | The object ids bundled under this tab. Use **＋ / －** to add/remove rows. |

**Custom Lighting box** (collapsible — click the header arrow) — geometry types only

By default the object uses the built-in nine-light rig. Toggle **Custom
Lighting** to override it with your own list.

| Control | Values / default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Custom Lighting** | off | When on, replaces the default rig with the lights below. With the list empty, the default rig is still used. |
| **(list) ＋ / －** | — | Add / remove a light. Each row shows its type and strength. |
| **Type** | Diffuse *(default)* / Specular | Directional diffuse light vs. specular highlight light. |
| **Casts Shadow** | off | Whether this light casts shadows. |
| **Direction** | `(0, 1, 0)` | Direction in OBJ space (+X forward, +Y up, +Z right); normalized at render time. |
| **Strength** | float, default `0.5`, min `0` | Intensity multiplier. |

**Bottom of panel**

| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Test Render** | Renders one viewpoint quickly and loads the sprite into an open Image Editor. Fast iteration; no `.parkobj` written. |
| **Export .parkobj** | Renders every sprite and writes a ready-to-install `.parkobj` (opens a file picker; defaults the name from **Object ID**). Both buttons run the renderer off the main thread with a status-bar spinner. |

### Panel: Selected Object → Scenery (per-object)

Shown for the selected mesh object.

| Control | Values / default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Role** | Geometry *(default)* / Ignore | Whether this object is part of the scenery model. **Ignore** excludes it from the render entirely (and hides the material controls below). |
| **Ghost** | off | Render this object as ghost geometry: primary rays trace through it (so it is not drawn) while it still contributes to the silhouette and ambient occlusion of solid parts. Works on static, animated, wall, door, and large scenery. |

**Materials box** — settings for the object's active material slot. With more
than one slot, a slot list lets you pick which material to edit. These replace
the MTL material-*name* keyword rules used by the CLI path.

| Control | Values / default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Glass** *(walls only)* | off | Translucent glass pane; split into the wall's glass overlay block. |
| **Wall Side** / **Banner Layer** *(walls & banners)* | Both/Front *(default)* / Front Only / Back Only | For a double-sided wall: which side this face belongs to ("Both" is shared). For a banner: **Back** = rear pole, **Front**/**Both** = front pole + sign. |
| **Region** | None *(default)* / Remap 1 (primary) / Remap 2 (secondary) / Remap 3 (tertiary) / Greyscale / Peep / Chain | How OpenRCT2 treats this material's pixels. The Remap regions are recoloured at runtime by the matching placement colour. |
| **Mask** | off | Treat as a collision/visibility mask. |
| **No Ambient Occlusion** | off | Disable AO for this material. |
| **Edge AA** | off | Enable background anti-aliasing blending on edges. |
| **Dark Edge AA** | off | Dark-variant background AA blending. |
| **No Bleed** | off | Disable colour bleed from neighbouring pixels. |
| **Texture** | *(none)* | Optional image. Must be saved to disk — its file is read at export time. |

**Shading** (sub-section of the Materials box) — Phong controls.

| Control | Values / default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Override Color** + **Color** | off / `(0.8, 0.8, 0.8)` | When on, use the picked flat diffuse colour instead of the shader's Base Color. The colour field is disabled until the toggle is on. |
| **Specular Exponent** | float, default `50`, min `1`, soft-max `256` | Phong highlight tightness: higher = smaller, sharper highlight. |
| **Specular Intensity** | float, default `0.5`, min `0`, soft-max `1` | Brightness of the specular highlight. |
| **Tint Highlight** + **Specular Tint** | off / white | When on, tint the specular highlight with the picked colour (off = white). The tint field is disabled until the toggle is on. |
